<!--
<tag>
    We have an opening tag, and a closing tag. Inside the tag, we write text.
</tag>

Browsers know we are typing html by writing DOCTYPE html
Then we tell that we are going to write the html

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <!--Includes extra symbols that are not on keyboard-->
        <meta charset="utf-8"/>
        <title> This is my first web page</title>
    </head>
    
    <body>
        I'm in the body. We write everything we want to see on webpage inside the body tags
    </body>
</html>
