        <p>The image should be in the same directory than the html file.</p>
        <p> We use img-tag which an attribute src, which links to the image path. In case the image cannot be found for a certain reason (spelling mistake for example), we can use alt to show the alternative of the image.</p>
        <p> Two other attributes are width and height</p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/PNG_transparency_demonstration_1.png" alt="Dice" height="1920" width="2310"/>
