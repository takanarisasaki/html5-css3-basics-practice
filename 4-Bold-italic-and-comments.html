    <body>
        <p>This text will be <strong>bold</strong> and some will be <em>italic</em> </p>
        <p>strong-tags make the text bold, and em-tags make the text italic</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Say I want to make a horizontal line to show that the two paragraphs are separated. Then we use hr-tag, like seen above</p>
        <p>We can make comments as well. Click cmd-slash and write comments inside.</p>
        <!--Inside, we write comments-->
