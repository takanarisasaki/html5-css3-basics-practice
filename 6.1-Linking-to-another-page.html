        <!--Now, I have to make a word or a text that will make the user go to the second page.-->
        <!--To make a link, we use a-tags-->
        <!--We give attributes, which are information to tell where to link to. a-tags alone doesn't know what is the link of second page-->
        <!--In href, we write the location to the second page.-->
